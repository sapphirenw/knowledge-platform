# AI Content Creation

## TODO

- [ ] Add errors to stored conversation messages
- [ ] Add users to customers, to allow for distinction based on users in a customer
- [ ] Edit the way LLMs are stored. Customers should define globals for actions, rather than a single default for all and passing in more custom ones later.
- [ ] Add customer limit configurations
- [ ] Auto-login and test links
