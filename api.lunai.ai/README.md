# AI Content Creation API

The content generation API provides access to the content generator, database, and llms through a declarative and well defined API.

## Getting Started

You need to define an environment file named `.env`. You can rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` with `mv .env.example .env` and then fill in the required env variables.

You can start the api with `make run`.
